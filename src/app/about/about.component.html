  <mat-card-content>
    <p>The academic preparation of infrastructure related disciplines usually takes place in isolated
      professional domains, rarely tackling problems in an interdisciplinary manner and/or learn from the systematic
      research of previous experiences. In order to address this issue, the Resilient Infrastructure and
      Sustainability Education – Undergraduate Program (RISE-UP) will provide the intellectual and practical academic
      space to generate case study research and turn them into hands-on solutions for real problems/projects, starting
      with
      the ones generated by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The timely collection of evidence of the
      infrastructure
      damages caused by the 2017 hurricanes in PR will facilitate the development of evidence-based solutions in the
      curriculum.
